'''Errors happen! To make sure your programs are error-proof and user-friendly, Python provides Exception Handling. It‚Äôs the art of catching errors and handling them gracefully.'''
'''
Basic Structure of try-except Blocks ‚öôÔ∏è

try: Runs code that might throw an error.
except: Catches the error, allowing you to respond without crashing.
Example 
'''
try:
    with open("nonexistent.txt", "r") as file:
        data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found. Please check the filename.")
    
'''
Advanced Error Handling with finally and Custom Errors üé©

finally: Runs no matter what, often used to clean up (like closing a file).
Custom Errors: Create custom exceptions for special cases (e.g., EmptyFileError).

Example with finally:
'''
try:
    file = open("sample.txt", "r")
    data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
finally:
    file.close()
